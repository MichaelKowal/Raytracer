#Raytracer

This is a quick project that I tackled to try and learn more about c++ and vector graphics.  The majority of it was done by following a guide [here](https://www.amazon.ca/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8).

Credit for the guide goes to Dr. Peter Shirley.

I hope to continue adding to this in the future and maybe roll it into some other projects I have planned.
